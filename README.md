# Ask-Socrates

By incorporating Platoâ€™s Dialogues and Wikipedia articles, Ask Socrates generates text written in the style of the Dialogues
while featuring content about recent event such as World War II, fake news, and the Mee Too movement. I coded in Python and
used Google Colab to train the models. Imported Markov Chains from Andrej Karpathy's GitHub repository. Although the grammar
and punctuation of the resulting texts aren't perfect, my starting point with creating this app was to bring ancient
philosophy to the questions of recent events, which we often fail to deeply contemplate upon in the hastle of daily life. 
However, the resulting text is rather a funny reading than a rigorous philosophical contemplation. 

#### Some excerpts:

 socrates: but why were you not say as you request me and not for their riches and their riding but now since the beginning
 of recorded history most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the good are to be of 
 any similar crime whether he be your mode of representation we are unable satisfactorily to decide which was also becoming
 more costly and its profitability had to give a reason of this projection let us take first the virtue of a woman is the same
 things are profitable
 
 crito: the dawn is breaking
 
 socrates: o hippias i do if hippias has no feeling of reverence and shame about the swift removal of many men in these
 matters if you approve of them even in this sort of accusations to which as far as we can at once find other and better
 principles i am very attentive to what thomas jefferson proclaimed that france had been enlightened
 
 euthyphro: true
